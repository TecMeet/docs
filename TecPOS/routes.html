<h2>How to configure, activate, save, diconnect, and terminate routes<a class="headerlink" href="#how-to-configure-activate-save-diconnect-and-terminate-routes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Create a new route. Tap Load Daily Route from the side menu and a screen with settings for your new route will appear. After having set the appropriate settings, you can either tap Save to store the new route until it’s needed later (useful for preplanning) or you can tap Activate Daily Route to enter the route immediately and be Active status in it. If you have saved a Route and wish to access it again, for instance to Activate it, tap Load Daily Route and then the three dot widget, then tap Load saved daily route, and tap the one you are looking for.
To add batch number, if your company has activated that setting, add a product to a Load Daily Route and tap it after it has been added. A dialog with header Set Batch Qty will appear. The first blank is the beach number, the second blank is the quantity. Click save and/or add a new one to the same product by clicking the plus list icon.
If you are a sales person user, you do not have permission to create a new daily route. You can however open and activate a daily route that has already been saved. Tap Load Daily Route and then the three dot widget, then tap Load saved daily route, and input the correct truck and route, then you will be able to activate that daily route.</p>
<p>Closing a daily route. Tap Close Daily Route in the side menu assuming you have an active daily route open. If you are not completely sure that you have all the sales and data correct for the current route, tap Disconnect in the lower left hand. This will allow you or someone else later to come back and make edits to the sales in the disconnected DR (Sales tab / three dot icon / Change DR#).
If you are sure that all data is correct and the route is complete, you can close the disconnected route from Close Daily Route tab and the Disconnected daily routes will appear in Need closing tab. Tap the one you want to close, set the products, and tap Close Route Now.
To close a route directly without disconnect, tap Close Daily Route and make sure the products have all been set and balanced, then tap Close Route Now in lower right hand corner to close the active daily route.</p>
