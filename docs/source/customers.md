## How to view, add, delete, edit, etc customers
Customers. The best way to access the customer list is to tap Sales in the side menu and click Customers in the middle of the bottom menu. To search and find a specific customer from that list, tap the magnifying glass icon in the top right, and type the name of the customer or store. 
To create a new customer, you must be on the Sales / Customers window as detailed above. This time you will click the plus button in the top right, which will open a window called Customer Edit. Place all of the customer's data in the appropriate fields and tap Save to save your new customer. 
To hide customers that are not on the current active Route, simply be in the Sales / Customers window as detailed above, and click the three dot icon in the top far right. A checkbox will appear which when checked will hide customers that are not on the current active route, and when unchecked will show all customers, even those not on the current route.
